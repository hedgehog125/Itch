**Update**: this repository has now be archived as I abandoned the idea. From my portfolio website, the reasons were:
> I previously mentioned on Scratch (although I apparently removed a lot of it) why I cancelled it but here's the rundown:
> * I was making it and realised using WebGL would make it much faster
> * WebGL is complicated so I looked into frameworks
> * I found Phaser and started making Frontier using it so I understood it
> * I realised making games is much easier and more fun with a framework
> * I had no reason to make Itch as Phaser was good enough for me (I guess that didn't completely turn out since I made JAMESCRIPT and Bagel.js)

It having a similar name to Itch.io is also unintentional, as I didn't know about it at the time. It's meant to be be similar to Scratch's name.
